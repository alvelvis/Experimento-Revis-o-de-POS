Pronouns are words that substitute for nouns or noun phrases, whose meaning is recoverable from the linguistic or extralinguistic context.

Lemmatization rules = ?

The possessive pronoun 'dele' (en = his) is tokenized as 'de' + 'ele' since in Portuguese it can be analysed as such. With this analysis, we keep the parallelism between other possessive constructions: de você (yours), de mim (mine). 


Examples

clitic pronouns: se, me, te, lhe (including reflexive pronouns)

demonstrative pronouns: isto, esse, aquilo

personal pronouns: eu, tu, ele, vocês

indefinite pronouns: um, outro, qualquer

possessive pronouns: meu, seu, dele

interrogative pronouns: que, quanto, qual

relative pronouns: que, cujo, qual

totality pronouns: todo, todas
