### Definition

An auxiliary verb is a verb that accompanies the lexical verb of a verb phrase and expresses grammatical distinctions not carried by the lexical verb, such as person, number, tense, mood, aspect, voice and modality.

In Portuguese, we consider `AUX` what linguists and grammaticians call: auxiliaries, aspectualizers and modal verbs.

We use three criteria to define an `AUX` in Portuguese:

*1) they share the same syntatical structures with the main verb: _Ele deixou cair o l치pis_ is analyzed as _Ele deixou o l치pis cair_, then "cair" is the main verb of a subordinate clause and not an `AUX`)

*2) they should bring grammatical information to the main verb

*3) they do not have a full semantic meaning (_Ele anda cantando_ = _anda_ as full semantic verb when "Ele canta enquanto anda"; _Ele anda cantando_ = _anda_  as a `AUX` verb, when "Ele tem cantando".



### Examples

- Tense auxiliary: _ir_ (futuro perifr치stico),
- Mode auxiliary: _V치 estudar!_ (imperative mode)
- Modal auxiliary: _poder_, _dever_,
- Aspectualizers: _continuar_, _finalizar_
- Passive auxiliary: _ser_, _ter_, _ir_.
